remember this is a person in a constant state of watching,
observing, and recording mentally. I am trying my best to bring
clarity to public minds, Things I can only truly theorize, after
all, history is only written by the rich. Be hyper aware reader,
knowledge of self is the first stepping stone of life, after you
learn to define yourself, the sooner you can see the world much
moreclearly.

3 Planes
Before wediveinto muchdeepertopics, weneedtostartwith
the foundations of the three-plane principles. We exist through
ourbodiesandmindsonthisplanet,butourspiritdoesn’tabide
by the samerestraints. While we sleep, our spirit is formless;
our physical and mental planes rest, and your spirit—being a
strong enoughplaneonitsown—leavestheshell. Ibelieve our
spirituality is somewhat a measure of our creative freedom and
prowess; howmuchyouwanttocreateisdictatedbyyourspirit
andtime. Everyone is here in our shells, simply being given the
chance to exist, but it’s become a game of “keep away” from
the general public.
Most people collectively have their own interpretations of
life, and mine follows the triad of planes, mainly because I have
experiencedpiecesfromeachplanewhichIwillrecallnow. From
a spiritual perspective, I have experienced a type of “god sight”
just being the energy within myself, with no restrictions. It’s
similar to being a camera able to moveatthewhimofyourwill,
watchingthephysicalandmentalplanefromwhereveryouwant
to be.
TheotherexperienceIrememberwasofanoldworld;I’dgive
a rough timeline of Ancient Greece or Rome, as I had a more
brutish leather armor on. I was able to remember helping an
older woman and the smile on her face, and briefly before I
wokeup,Ifelt aswordthroughmyback. Mycurrentbodydoes
have abirthmarkthat Iwouldcorrelate to this event or lifetime.
Both of these experiences, I believe, show me a route to the
understanding or experiences I have had in mycurrentlife.
Attheageof5or6,Iremembermybrothercomplainingabout
aspiritthathidawayinhiscloset. Andonedayhelefthisroom—
and myroomwasnothing more than a walkway and enough
room for my bed to slide against 3 of my walls. I remember
feeling the energy in the air change, a most profound feeling
of heaviness morethananything,andwhenIopenedmyeyes
I looked at the door of mybrother’s room. It wasahumanoid
being, but where light would hit the spirit, it was emitting a red
hue. This spirit was not only a part of that house but also didn’t
wanttoleave;whetherit’sresentmentoranger,itwasn’thappy
andwantedotherstofeelhow“he”felt.
The second occurrence was this same spirit telling me he
didn’t like my cousin. Within maybe10secondsofsayingthat, I
told mymom,inwhichhestartedcrying,andthennolessthan
10 seconds after that, this 20-ish pound heavy woodenpicture
frame holder fell off the wall. It unhinged from 2 heavy-duty
nails in the wall and fell where mycousinwaslaying.
The last one came from when I was in a hotel at the age of
18. I was sitting up in bed watching the television, and the
sameheavinessconsumedme,butIwasabletoseethissame

was I able to regain my bodily autonomy, process what I just
witnessed, and understand what happened.
